## 💡 Pro Tips

### 1. **Shorten the URL**
Use a URL shortener for cleaner sharing:
```
Original: https://cannaverdict.com/spec?auto=1&max=15
Shortened: https://bit.ly/magic123
```

### 2. **Customize Max Effects by Victim**
- Tech-savvy friend: `?auto=1&max=20` (longer show)
- Easily scared: `?auto=1&max=5` (quick scare)
- Boss/authority: `?auto=1&max=3` (brief demo)

### 3. **Test Before Sending**
Always test your URL first:
```
1. Open in incognito window
2. Check timing feels right
3. Verify effects work
4. Then share with victim
```

### 4. **Combine with Other Tricks**
```
"Hey, can you test if this website works on your phone?"
→ They're helping you, not suspicious
→ More likely to grant permissions
→ Better magic reveal
```

### 5. **No Evidence Left**
After redirect to Google:
- Can't go "back" to see what happened
- Browser history just shows Google
- No trace of the magic trick
- Perfect crime! 😈
