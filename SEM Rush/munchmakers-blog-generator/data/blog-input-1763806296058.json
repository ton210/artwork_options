      "prompt": "What are the best options for personalized BIC lighters?\n",
      "response": "What are the best options for personalized BIC lighters?\nResponse\nIf you’re looking for personalized options for BIC lighters in the United States, here are some of the best choices, along with what to watch out for and tips to get the best result.\n\n✅ Top Options\nBIC’s own “Design My BIC® Lighters”\n\nOn BIC’s official site you can order a set of 6 custom-lighters: upload photos, use templates, add text/clip-art.\nPrice starts around US $29.99 for 6 (≈ $5 each) and volume discounts apply.\nGood for smaller personal orders (weddings, gifts). Lead time: 2-4 weeks.\nNote: Warning label and QR code area cannot be removed, so adjust your design accordingly.\nPromotional / bulk customizers\n\nSites like SimplyLighters offer full-wrap, 360° digital print around the entire lighter body (for large quantities) in the US.\nOthers: NIK Printing Design: fully wrapped BIC lighters from quantities of ~1,200 units.\nLogoRollingPapers: Another supplier, offering minimums ~300 units and pricing as low as ~$1.30 each for large orders.\nGanjaPrint: Offers custom BIC lighters starting ~$1.10 each for very large quantities.\n🎯 Which to pick depending on your need\nSmall personal batch (for an event/gift) → Use BIC’s “Design My BIC” (6-pack)\nMedium to large quantity (300+ units, e.g., for business, promo or giveaway) → Use a bulk customizer\nFull-wrap vs simple logo imprint → If you want a full graphic all around the lighter, go with companies offering “full wrap”. If just a logo on one side, simpler imprint services will suffice.\n📝 Things to check / design guidelines\nMake sure the supplier is officially licensed to print BIC brand lighters (authentic BIC quality).\nArtwork-guidelines: According to BIC’s official production guidelines: max 4 imprint colours per side, no greyscale/gradations in certain cases, and you must comply with their legal/artwork terms.\nSafety & warning labels: Custom printed BIC lighters will still have the mandatory warning label and possibly QR code or tracking code – you’ll need to plan your design accordingly (i.e., leave space).\nMinimum order quantities: Many bulk services require minimums e.g., 300 units, 600, 1,200 or more depending on custom features.\nLead time: Custom orders often take 2-4 weeks or more (or longer for large runs).\nCost per unit will drop as you order more units (volume discount) — good to check pricing tiers.\nBody colour + imprint colour: On dark coloured lighters you may need white or metallic ink or extra treatment for print to show up well. Some sites charge extra for additional colours.\n🔍 My recommendation\nIf I were to choose one best option for most people in the U.S. wanting personalized BIC lighters (for, say, a wedding or small event), I’d recommend going with BIC’s own “"
