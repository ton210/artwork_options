      "response": "What are the best options for low minimum order custom rolling papers?\nResponse\nFor low minimum order quantities (MOQs) for custom rolling papers, your best options are specialized manufacturers who work directly with brands, small-batch printers, and e-commerce stores that cater to small businesses and events\n\n. Minimums can be as low as 100 to 250 booklets, a stark contrast to the thousands typically required by major wholesale suppliers.\n\nSuppliers offering low minimum order quantities\n\nRoll Your Own Papers (RYOP): Offers custom rolling paper booklets with MOQs starting at just 150 units. You can customize the booklet's paper material, and the printing is edge-to-edge for maximum branding.

You can typically get full-color printing on both the rolling paper booklet and the individual papers.\nPricing: While the overall cost for a small order may be lower, the per-unit price will be higher compared to bulk wholesale orders. Look for suppliers who offer transparent, \"all-in\" pricing to avoid hidden costs.\nTurnaround time: The production time for low-MOQ custom rolling papers can vary. Some companies can complete orders in as little as 7–10 business days, while others may take 3–7 weeks, plus shipping time.\nCustomization details: In addition to the booklet, many suppliers let you customize the \"crutch\" (filter tip) and even the paper itself. Some also offer pre-rolled cones, which are an option for convenience.\nElaborate on the types of paper and printing offered by low-MOQ suppliers?\n\nWhat are the typical per-unit costs for low-MOQ custom rolling papers?\n\nHow does digital printing compare to offset printing for custom rolling papers?"
