      "response": "Response\nChoosing the right rolling paper depends on several factors, including the material, thickness, size, and flavor, all of which affect your smoking experience\n\n. Your skill level and how you plan to use the paper are also key considerations. \n\nChoose a paper based on material \n\nPaper Type\tCharacteristics\tBest for...\nWood Pulp\tThe most traditional and widely available type. Thicker, durable, and the easiest to roll, but it has a faster burn rate and may add a papery aftertaste. Available in bleached (white) and unbleached (brown) options, with the latter containing fewer chemicals.\tBeginners who want a forgiving and easy-to-handle paper.\nHemp\tAn eco-friendly and sustainable option made from the fibers of the hemp plant. It is thinner than wood pulp, with a slightly earthy taste, but is still sturdy enough for easy rolling. Hemp papers offer a slow, even burn for longer sessions.\tThose who want a natural, sustainable option that is easy to roll and burns slowly.\nRice\tMade from processed rice, these papers are ultra-thin and almost transparent. They offer a clean, tasteless smoke that allows the flavor of your herb to shine. Rice papers burn very slowly but can be more difficult to roll due to their delicate nature.\tExperienced rollers who prioritize flavor purity and a long, slow burn.\nFlax\tOften blended with other fibers, flax paper provides a middle ground between the durability of wood pulp and the thinness of rice paper. It offers a slow, even, and flavorless burn.\tSmokers who want a durable, but still light and flavorless paper.\nTransparent Cellulose\tA unique, clear paper made from plant cellulose. It offers a smooth, slow burn but can be slippery and difficult to handle.\tSmokers seeking a novelty or aesthetically interesting experience.\nConsider paper thickness and burn rate \n\nThe thickness of a paper is directly related to its burn speed and ease of use. \n\nThicker papers, like those made from wood pulp, are easier for beginners to roll but burn faster.\nUltra-thin papers, such as rice or flax, provide a slower, more controlled burn and interfere less with the flavor of your smoke.
